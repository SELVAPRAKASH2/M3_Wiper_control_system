## WIPER SYSTEM

## ABSTRACT :
  The aim of this project is to make and develop a Wiper control system. Here, We used LED's instead of wiper motor. This LED's are used in different colours to indicating the speed of the wiper motor. Where the RED colour LED is used to indicate the slow wiping speed, this RED LED blinks slower. Where the GREEN colour LED is used to indicate the medium wiping speed, this GREEN colour LED blinks faster than RED coloured LED. Where the ORANGE colour LED is used to indicate the fast wiping, this ORANGE colourd LED blinks faster than the other LED's.
